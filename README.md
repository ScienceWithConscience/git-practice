# git-practice

Welcome! This is a repository you can safely make commits to and play around with to learn how to
use git and github.

There are several tasks that we suggest you complete before starting your S2DS course to get some
practice working with others on the same files. This often happens when working as part of a group,
but is something that is hard to replicate when working on your own. In particular, we would like to
give you some experience in merging branches and dealing with merge conflicts.

The first part of this `README.md` markdown file will contain instructions, the second part of this
file will be the part that you edit. You can edit this file multiple times - doing so will give you more
practice, and help others out by creating merge conflicts.

Please do not edit any of this files contents above the section `Edit This`.

# Tasks

1. Clone this repo to your computer.
2. Checkout to a new branch using `git checkout -b git-practice-your-name` eg. `git checkout -b git-practice-alex-hampton`
3. Edit the section `Edit This`. Add your name to the first sentence, and then add 3-5 facts  - they can
be about you, or anything interesting. Please make them different to the version on your local
`master branch` - ie. if someone says what their favourite colour is, don't put your favourite colour.
We want these facts to be different from the previous person to create conflicts.
4. Push your branch using `git push`
